# marbelous

Marbelous is an app that digitizes the traditional marble game Congkak/Mancala.

In this two-player game, players aim to collect the most number of marbles in their 'home'. The rules of the game are as follows:

There are 6 pits on each side of the board and 1 store for each player at their left end <br/>
Each pit contains 7 marbles<br/>
Players take turns to move marbles clockwise, dropping marbles in each pit & store except the opponent’s store<br/>
If final marble lands in the the player’s own store, the player gets to go again<br/>
If final marble lands in the player’s own pit that is empty, they get to collect all the marbles on the opposite pit and put everything in the player's own store<br/>
The game ends when one player’s pits are completely empty. The opponent adds all the marbles in their pit to their own store, and the player with the most marbles wins!<br/>
